# Adafruit RP2040 KiCAD symbol and footprint

This is an unofficial KiCAD V6 symbol and footprint for the Adafruit Feather RP2040 board. I made these for the Gen 2 revision of my  [keyboard switch force curve meter project](https://github.com/bluepylons/Open-Switch-Curve-Meter).

The PCB footprint has been verified to fit a Feather RP2040 physically, but other aspects (e.g. whether the schematic symbol is correct) have not yet been tested yet.
